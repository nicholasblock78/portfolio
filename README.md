###Notes:
Fresh 2023 updates forthcoming!
I decided to leverage the Middleman framework, a static site generator, to build my website as I had no need for a database and really no dynamic content. They have some really neat features that helped organize my code and made building my site much more enjoyable. ([Check them out here!](https://middlemanapp.com/)).

My views are generated using the default Erb for my preprocessed HTML, but I'm hoping to have time to try out Pug or Haml. I used jQuery to help boost the visual appeal and UX of my site.

If you have any ideas on how to help make my site better, please drop me a line! I always appreciate any and all advice. Thanks! Hope you enjoy!
