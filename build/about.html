	<h3>Who am I?</h3>
	<p>I'm a down to earth, fun loving, hardworking type of guy -- who's bright, energetic, and almost always the happiest guy in the room. Forever curious at heart, I solve problems by constantly exploring new persepctives of the bigger picture. I pride myself on having high emotional intelligence and using that to help others. All in all, I enjoy wearing many hats and will never stop chasing my best self. </p>
	<h3>Inspiration</h3>
	<p>Losing over 120 pounds and keeping it off. What an incredible difference it's made in my life! I hope some of my work will help enable others acheive the same results and happiness. My desire to help people lose weight has turned into a passion for helping others in any way I'm able.</p>
	<h3>Why coding?</h3>
	<p>I graduated from the University of Iowa in 2014 with a degree in Health &amp; Human Physiology. Up until this point, I had been mainly interested in the nutrition and sciences, particularly for my own well-being. I developed a strong passion for helping others achieve the same happiness I had found by taking control of my health. Unsure of how to utilize my degree and achieve positive change in the world, my post college plan was to work my way up in my fields of interest. I spent two summers as an outdoor adventure camp counselor accompanying kids on overnight trips around the Midwest. I spent time in numerous restaurant settings while taking personal training classes. Nothing stuck. Disillusioned, I knew I needed a change. That's when I found <em>The Creative Circus</em> in Atlanta, GA. </p>
	<p>My summer in Atlanta was an unforgettable experience. This creative advertising school exposed me to the field of Interactive Development, all the while teaching me not to be afraid of putting my ideas out there. I learned to become very comfortable being uncomfortable - an essential in the field of programming. The lessons I learned there were what drove me to Dev Bootcamp less than a year later.</p>
